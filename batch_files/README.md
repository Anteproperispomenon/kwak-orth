# Batch Files

These are batch files to use on Windows only.
To use them, find `kwak-orth-exe.exe` in 
`...\stack-work\install\...\bin` and then copy
it and the batch files to the directory of
your choice. Then, you can run the program
by dragging and dropping text files onto
the relevant batch files.
